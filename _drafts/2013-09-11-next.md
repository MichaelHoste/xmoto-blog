The moto starts to react to physic ! (inputs are not well defined, the scale is not right and I still have some precision issues, but that still a big step for me since it's the first time I use box2D and specific joints like revolute joints & prismatic joints)

Yep but more slower... I've had a hard time to adjust the display of the axles (not sure about the word, I mean the "tube" between the body of the moto and the wheel). But I'm almost there, just a little more trigonometry and it's done ^^

And I created a "camera" that moves with the moto.

As usual, work in progress here : http://michaelhoste.github.io/xmoto/
And list of commits (for the coders) : https://github.com/MichaelHoste/xmoto/commits/master

NEXT :
* Finish the "axles" display.
* Better inputs (remove the small delay between key pressed and repetition of keys).
* Add the biker on the moto.
* Adjust the physics.

This is a long term project, I have to work on it for months when I have some time (side-project). Don't hope to have it in production for next month :-)

And if some coders want to help on a specific part (replay ? better level importation (edges) ?) I'd be happy to get them started.
